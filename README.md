# SAP HANA Enterprise Search Engine
[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/hana-enterprise-search-engine)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/hana-enterprise-search-engine)

## Documentation
Check out the documentation [here](https://sap-samples.github.io/hana-enterprise-search-engine/)

## Description
This enterprise search engine example program shows how to utilize [SAP HANA Search](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_HANA_PLATFORM/691cb949c1034198800afde3e5be6570 "HANA search developer guide") which is part of both, cloud and on-premise shipments, of [SAP HANA DB](https://www.sap.com/products/hana.html). It provides REST-APIs for search and CRD (create, read, delete) to process structured business objects and their relationships. To do so, it maps this business perspective to a technical perspective which is then processed by HANA. [SAP CAP](https://cap.cloud.sap) can be used to model the business objects and their relationships. The example also shows how to use the enterprise search UI which is delivered as part of SAP UI5. Programming language is Python.

## Known Issues
This is an example application in an early stage of development, so
- don't store personal information because of missing access logging
- don't store sensitive information because there is no access control
- don't use the example application productively because users and passwords generated by config.py are stored plaintext in src/.config.json
- make sure that your system setup (tenent creation, post data model, post data) is completely automated as there is no migration provided between different (minor) versions of this example
- don't expect mature error handling. Use the provided tests as a starting point


## How to obtain support
This is an example application and not supported by SAP. However, you can 
[create an issue](https://github.com/SAP-samples/<repository-name>/issues) in this repository if you find a bug or have questions about the content.
