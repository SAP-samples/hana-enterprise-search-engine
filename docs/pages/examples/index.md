Demo examples show the usage of the OpenAPI search API utilizing Python notebooks and the Python client library. They can be found in the notebooks sub-folder of the respective [example](https://github.com/SAP-samples/hana-enterprise-search-engine/demo/examples). The Python notebooks can be executed in Visual Studio code.

Two generic notebooks exist to manage tenants. Use those to setup a tenant for the example you are interested in.
- [setup.ipynb](https://github.com/SAP-samples/hana-enterprise-search-engine/demo/notebooks/setup.ipynb) is used to setup a new tenant
- [delete_tenant.ipynb](https://github.com/SAP-samples/hana-enterprise-search-engine/demo/notebooks/setup.ipynb) is used to delete a tenant

Each demo example gets its own tenant named {example_name}DemoExample. E.g. the simple example gets the simpleDemoExample tenant.
